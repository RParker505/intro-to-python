# Introduction To Python

## Objective
Build the command line version of a Recipe App that takes advantage of Pythonâ€™s object-oriented nature. 

## Exercise 1.1

### Step 1: Install Python 3.8.7 on your system

### Step 2: Set up a new virtual environment

### Step 3: Create a script that adds two numbers together

### Step 4: Set up an IPython shell
Install IPython with `pip install ipython` from the virtual environment.
To launch the shell, run command `ipython`.

### Step 5: Create requirements.txt file
Generate file with command `pip freeze > requirements.txt` from the virtual environment

_And test it with a copied environment using_ `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Exercise 1.2

### Step 1: Create recipe_1

recipe_1 should be a dictionary as it will include several key-value pairs:
- name: tea
- cooking_time: 5 (in minutes)
- ingredients: Tea leaves, Sugar, Water

### Step 2: Create all_recipes and add recipe_1 to it

all_recipes will be an outer structure to house not only recipe_1, but additional recipes as well. As it will house several dictionaries, all_recipes itself will also be a dictionary.

### Step 3: Create additional recipes

The additional recipes should follow the same structure as recipe_1 and should also be added to the all_recipes dictionary.

### Step 4: Print ingredient lists of all recipes

Use `list()` and `values()` functions to create a list of all the recipe values. Then, iterate over each recipe in the new list and print the ingredients for each recipe as a list.
